# Work Order System

v41-geckos-team-08

# Description

The Work Order System defines users as either consumers or suppliers, with each creating an authenticated profile. The supplier will specify the product that they offer on signup. Consumers can search for products offered by different suppliers. After the consumer selects a supplier, both parties can negotiate the rates and time of completion. Afterwards, they'll both be required to indicate that the work order is complete.

This project is part of [Chingu's](https://chingu.io/) Voyage 41 cohort.

Objective was to reach a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the first release.
